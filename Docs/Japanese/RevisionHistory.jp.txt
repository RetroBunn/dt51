=============================
Known bugs 
=============================
1.  Text normalization for numbers.  This will be fixed in future revisions.
2.  Kanji and Hiragana pronunciations don't always match.  This has to do with the Onsei dictionary, and is in progress.
3.  Some over generalization on the i and u deletion rule.  This has to do with the lts rules and will be fixed in future revisions.
