  <P>While Korean has three distinctive voiceless stops as phonemes, English has 
  two distinctive stops: voiceless stops /p, t, k/ and voiced stops /b, d, g/. 
  Voiceless stops are aspirated in the word initial or in the stressed-syllable 
  initial position, but they are not aspirated after /s/ and in the 
  unstressed-syllable initial position, and they remain unexploded in the 
  syllable coda position. The following show the Korean and English stop 
  phonemes and allophones. The most similar sounds are linked together. [<FONT 
  size=-1><I>Note: English unaspirated voiceless stops sound more similar to 
  Korean fortis stops rather than lenis stops. </I></FONT>]

  for English /p, t, k/, and Korean /p, t, k/ for English /b, d, g/, which 
  causes a devoicing problem in the word initial or word final position. [<FONT 
  size=-1><I>Note: Actually, the result of Major &amp; Faudree (1996) shows that 
  the voiced stops in the word initial position are not a big problem to Korean 
  learners of English. They conclude that the subjects overcame the difficulty 
  of voicing in the word initial position. However, according to Ladefoged 
  (1993), native listeners of English differentiate a voiceless stop and a 
  voiced stop in the word initial position by the presence of aspiration not by 
  the presence of voicing, and also those in the word final position by the 
  duration of preceding vowels not by the presence of voicing, since English 
  stops in those positions are partially devoiced. Thus, the Korean speakers do 
  not seem to have problems in differentiating voiceless stops (= aspirated 
  ones) and voiced stops (= unaspirated lenis ones) in the word initial 
  position. However, many Korean learners of English do not know that the vowel 
  duration is longer before a voiced consonant than before a corresponding 
  voiceless consonant. This must have lead to much poorer result in the 
  production of word final voiced stops in Major &amp; Faudree's (1996) 
  experiment.</I></FONT> ] The following are consonant substitutions (H-B Park,

  <P>Not only the phoneme inventories but also the syllable structures of 
  English and Korean are quite different from each other. The Korean syllable 
  structure is much simpler than that of English: V, CV or CVC. It does not 
  allow consonant clusters, <FONT size=-1><I>[Note: There is some debate about 
  the treatment of glide in the Korean syllable structure. It has usually been 
  regarded as part of a vowel (C-W Kim &amp; H-Y Kim, 1991) owing to the 
  orthography, but recently there is another claim that it may not part of a 
  vowel but an onset element (YS Lee, 1983). If such a claim is admitted, we may 
  say Korean allows a consonant cluster only in the form of "C + G" in the 
  syllable onset position. However, because this issue is beyond the scope of 
  the present study, it will not be considered further here.]</I></FONT> and the 
  syllable coda position is restricted to only lenis stops /p, t, k/, nasals /m, 
  n, <IMG

  <P>Broselow (1987:272) proposes the following Syllable Structure Transfer 
  Hypothesis: 
  <P>
  <TABLE cellPadding=2>
    <TBODY>
    <TR>
      <TD vAlign=top>(3) </TD>
      <TD><B>Syllable Structure Transfer Hypothesis</B><BR>When the target 
        language permits syllable structures which are not permitted in the 
        native language, learners will make errors which involve altering these 
        structures to those which would be permitted in the native language. 
    </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
  <P>Korean speakers learning English seem to support this hypothesis. Inserting 
  a vowel, they try to break consonant clusters. They also insert a vowel after 
  a fricative or an affricate sound, since fricatives or affricates in the 
  syllable coda position, without vowel insertion, would be neutralized as /t/ 
  under the application of SFNR (1). That is, bus might be homophonous with but. 
  Due to the epenthesis, the original syllable-final fricative or affricate is 
  resyllabified as a syllable-initial one, and can be realized as a more similar 
  sound to the target language (Nam &amp; Southard, 1994:267). A high front 
  vowel /i/ is inserted after a palatal sound such as /<IMG

  align=top>, <IMG 
  src="Interlanguage Phonology of Korean Learners of English_files/zh.gif"

  align=top>/ and a high back unrounded vowel /<IMG 
  src="Interlanguage Phonology of Korean Learners of English_files/uu.gif">/ is 
  inserted elsewhere (Ahn, 1991:15; Tak, 1996:768, 775). The following are some 
  examples of vowel insertion by Korean speakers: <PRE>(4)   a.

  (4b), /r/ in the coda position is deleted, since Korean syllable system does 
  not allow /r/ in this position, and instead its preceding vowel is 
  compensatorily lengthened. <FONT size=-1><I>[This is by chance similar to 
  British English. However, usually, Korean speakers are not taught British 
  English pronunciation at school. If /r/ is not deleted, it may be neutralized 
  as /l/ by Korean speakers, which must lead to a more undesirable 
  result.]</I></FONT> <BR><IMG

  On the other hand, H-B Park (1992) insists that Korean speakers insert /<IMG

  she insists that an English syllable-final voiced stop is epenthesized when 
  following a long vowel or a diphthong, and that it is unreleased when 
  following a short vowel. In fact, a syllable-final voiced stop tends to be 
  epenthesized quite easily, even if it is preceded by a short/lax vowel as 
  shown in [k<IMG

  investigate which strategy (devoicing but keeping the syllable structure, or 
  preserving voicing but adding a syllable through vowel insertion) Korean 
  speakers use more often in such a situation and which is better on the 
  viewpoint of intelligibility by native speakers of English. To sum up, the 
  vowel insertion rules can be formulated as follows:

  <P>In conclusion, Korean learners of English tend to transfer Korean 
  phonological rules such as SFNR, LSVR, NasR, etc. to English. They also use 
  vowel insertion to admit permissible syllable structures. The degree of 
  transfer consistency of these rules may be different from each other. That is, 
  those who transfer LSVR also seem to transfer NasR, but those who do not 
  transfer NasR do not seem to transfer LSVR. In order to elucidate such a 
  postulation, more empirical research is required. Such a difference would be a 
  good tool for judging the development degree of an L2 learner's acquisition of 
  L2 phonology or the degree of his or her fossilization in L2 pronunciation.
