These are the lists used in the Italian word grammar. The word grammar is in
verbgrammar.tab. Most of the entries in the .tab files (like verbsare.tab)
have no right side since finding the pronunciation is not the purpose of these
lists. It's only for finding where the stredss should go, see verbgrammar.tab.

The totaltity of all the lists contains 12430 lines but mainly no right
sides. See in all.tab which was generated by:
