Instructions on how to create the pdb files for downloading Fonix supporting files for Fonix applications
to a Palm device.

Navigate to your "par" program in a dos window.
Copy the file you wish to convert to this directory.

Type the following on the command line:
(This is the syntax you should use)
par c -a "stream" filename.pdb filename TYPE CID filename.extension

example:
par c -a "stream" ipp.pdb ippl libr STRT ippSP_XSC40PPC_r.lib

Where the following parameters are defined:

filename
	
	PNNF - Palm Neural Net File - use for all neural nets
	PDIC - Palm dictionary File - use for all dictinary files
TYPE
	DATA - data file
	libr - library

CID - creator id name
	STRT - CID for examples, need to use CID that I created for fonix projects:
	FDT1 - dectalk projects
	FVR1 - asr projects

	might register these for future use:
	PNNF - Palm Neural Net File - use for all neural nets
	PDIC - Palm dictionary File - use for all dictinary files
