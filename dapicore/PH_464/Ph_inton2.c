 *    Revision History:
 * Rev  Who     Date            Description
 * ---  -----   -----------     -------------------------------------------- 
 * 0001 DK 		12/16/1984		Initial creation
 * 0002 DGC		12/27/1984		Version for 80186, use mstofr()
 * 0003 DK		01/09/1985		Fix handling of user inputted f0 commands
 * 0004 DK		01/21/1985		Fix bug causing f0 to drift down in long sentences
 * 0005 DK		03/01/1985		Reduce pitch gestures in a clause ended by "?"
 * 0006 DK		04/18/1985		Try releasing final nasals into silence for intellig.
 * 0007 DK		04/25/1985		Fix continuation rise so not too early
 * 0008 DK		05/17/1985		F0 fall cannot occur too early in a long vowel
 * 0009 DK		06/14/1985		Fix f0 fall for f0mode=HAT_LOCATIONS_SPECIFIED
 * 0010 DK		06/19/1985		Fix insertion of dummy-vowel phoneme
 * 0011 MGS		03/25/1996		Merged WIN 95 code to 42c 
 * 0012 MGS		04/01/1996		Added MSDBG blocks
 * 0013 MGS		06/04/1996		Merged Spanish with English 
 * 0014	MGS		06/06/1996		Changed file name from phinton.c ph_inton.c
 * 0015 EDB		01/10/1997		Fix many data.
 * 0016 EAB		02/22/1997		Copied rule 3 was checked to make it work with new doitlater code in ph_aloph
 *								It has to be in twice so that the rules fire in the proper order i.e. otherwise
 *								rule 4 will fire before rule three in a normal ordering. Time eprmitting later
 *								thus may be able to be simplified.
 * 0017 EAB		04/09/1997		Fixed hat_rise fall phonemic markings see note below
 *								Fixes BAT 346
 * 0018 EAB		04/18/1997		Completed merge with 5.0 and French plus fixed a problem where somehow and extra line of code
 *								erroneuosly snuck in.
 * 0019 EAB		05/15/1997		Found that hat_rise hat_fall still didn't work and traced problem back to rewrite in1984
 *								I also removed uneeded restriction that a hat_rise couldn't operate if someone had already
 *								put in a hat rise. Let people do whatever they want aldo this removed the variable hatpos
 *								The code now assigns the hat rise or fall to the next phoneme that is FSYLL perhaps later
 *								we might want to open it up to FSONOR. Also night want to defferiate final fall effects from
 *								final hat fall and not have it automatic.
 *
 * 0020 KSB		05/20/1997		Moved f0 and place to gl_phones
 * 0021 EAB		06/02/1997		Fixed redundant line of code (looks like editing mistake) no no note at delete
 * 0022 EAB		09/08/1997		EAB Don't you DARE try to diff this with a previous version major surgery
 *								and this is only the beginning also this re-write removed the need for even odd 
 *								enforcement on commands so I removed the unnecessary code
 * 0023 EAB		12/12/1997		Modify code for UK_English
 * 0024 EAB		01/10/1997		Added length parameter to Make_f0_command glide will be the first command to use this.
 * 0025 EAB		01/22/1998		Modified UK English intonation rules per Caroline
 * 0026 EAB		01/22/1998		Put in a bit of a kludge so that last syllable gesture
 *								(rule 23) occurs on the last syllable as desired for UK English
 *								and not on last STRESSED syllable as in American English bats 575
 * 0027 EAB		02/10/1998		Submitted wrong version with a bug causing last gesture to be incorrect BATS 600
 * 0028 EAB		02/16/1998		Re-wrinting for 4.5+ go get all on the same base 
 * 0029 EAB		03/02/1998		Added length to IMPULSE commands to support new command syntax ( note step by definition
 *								have a length of zero-we could change it to be a ramp
 * 0030	gl		03/25/1998		Added DBGV command for PH debug variable passing
 *								also add dectalkf.h to catch the defined symbol
 *								For BATS#639 to change phinton() to use argument phTTS instead of pDph_t
 * 0031 EAB		04/10/1998		Add new German tuning rules plus add new parameters for debug printout to Make_f0
 * 0032 EAB		06/07/1998		eab 7/8/98 Begin to remove hat rise hat fall pattern. It doesn't just do the rise fall so like
								a cancer tumor the removal must be carefully done
 * 0033 EAB		07/08/1998		BATS 711 found bug in counting tcumdur + 709 German tuning
 * 0034 EAB		07/22/1998		First pass at adding wordfeatr with part of speech
								to intonation. Removed old GERMAN unused wordclass...
 * 0035 EAB		07/24/1998		Modified calling handle of MAKE_F0 to support debug printouts
 * 0036 EAB		08/17/1998		Spanish tuning with Juan
 * 0037 EAB		09/11/1998		Still improving/experimenting to improve naturalness
 * 0038 EAB		09/29/1998		Found some hidden problems ewhere values
 *								were getting sucked out of ROM.c instead of locally --also
 *								tuned for SPANISH_LA
 * 0039 EAB		10/16/1998		Final tuning from new release of spanish
 * 0040 EAB		10/22/1998		Bats 776- Some arrays were too short for max pointer movement
 *								causing a failure depending on whether the data follwoing the array 
 * 								was freindly or unfreindly values......
 * 0041 EAB						Further tuning of intonation values for relelase
 * 0042 EAB		11/04/1998		Final glotalization gesture is very sensitive to timing and needs to be adjusted in onset if
 *								the phoneme following the syllable nucleus is voiced BATS 796.
 * 0043 EAB		11/06/1998		Final adjustments for new release-this file is not the default version but I wanted to give an
 *								option to chose it BATS 807
 * 0044 EAB		11/09/1998		Tuned the UK_English male and female voice BATS 777
 *								if (new_intonation enabled for UK) This as part of the overall 5.0
 *								tuning process file in AD already contains changes 
 * 0045 EAB		11/10/1998		Fixed BATS 791 failure was dur to the fact that typing mode
 *								sent data without and end of clause which ph can handle but the tcumdur
 *								calulation was not handling correctly.
 * 0046	GL		11/20/1998		BATS#828 use PH_DEBUG to replace _DEBUG
 * 0047 EAB		02/03/1999		Added change from NWSNOAA->NWS_US for multi language NOA
 *								Plus did some tuning and added an printout to verifiy that some code is no longer
 *								needed and can be removed later and chnaged a variale name to a more explanatory one
 * 0048 EAB						Added in copyright notices plus trying to tune this ad code
 * 0049 EAb		06/07/1999		BATS 897
 * 0050 EAB		04/17/1999		Tuning changes for 4.6
 * 0051 EAB		04/18/1999		Fixed ifdef for UK for N_last_sylL...
 * 0052 CAB		03/15/2000		WINprintf not supported under Windows CE
