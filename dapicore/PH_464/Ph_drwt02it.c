Later edit history of old ph_drwt0.c

* 0017 SIK 	07/12/1996		Cleaning up and maintenance
* 0018 GL		09/10/1996		Add printf("\n") for WIN95 dologphone()
* 0019 GL		09/10/1996		Add debug switch to dump phone logging.
* 0020 EDB 	01/10/1997		Fix many data. simplify the Spanish code.
* 0021 EAB 	7/8/97			More tuning of merged vocal tract.
* 0022 EAB 	9/29/98 		Refining and tuning the new intonation lot's of small
changes 
End old comments

  *	0021 EAB		04/02/97		Merged to support both French and 5.0 merges
  Added new variables also need to update phinton.c because these
  are partner files. Chnages too numerous to iterate because this version
  is architectually different from the old. Consider it a new file.
  *	0022 EAB		04/04/97		EAB Removed new_sentence from german it existed but did nothing
  *	0023 EAB		04/14/97		Moved functional ifdef NEWBASELINE to phdefs because it wil encompass
  *									changes to more than just ph_inton.
  *	0024 KSB		05/20/1997		Moved f0 and place to gl_phones
  *	0025 EAB		9/8/97			Merged into RND for NOAA and possibly KURZ forget about diffing
  *	0026 EAB/CJL	11/07/97		Female NWSNOAA & GRAPHF0 code. Instead of adding all the peices
  toegther and then scaling the entire mess. I broke the f0 code into it's 
  constiuent pieces and added at the end. This is both for the US and for NOAA.
  This makes it possible to have diferent parts scale differently in the female
  (and male) voices. ALso he base DC level the baseline was also sent through the low
  pass filter. It agains reduces flexibility and their is no reason to do this.
  
	*	0027  EAB		11/11/97		Since the code issue is very sensitive I have added a MALFEM switch so that you get
	EXactly the OLD code if it's a male voice and the new code I need for the female voice
	Acutally this may be good for a while to try to improve the female voice weithout worrying
	about breaking the amle voice.
	*	0028  EAB		11/22/97		Remove glotalization from UK_ENGLISH per Caroline.
	*	0029  EAB		11/24/97		Remove creek from male voice only per noaa/carl
	*	0030  EAB		01/10/98		Added length parameter to code (glide command first to use
	*	0031  EAB		01/21/98		Added the glide command which cause a pitch rise or fall that occurs over the length
	*									of the phoneme linearly and then remains at the level reached
	*	0032  EAB		01/21/98		Added baseline profile per caroline as well as disabled unsed UK commands 
	by adding a break;
	*	0033  EAB		02./16/98		Removing old garbage (get_cos routine, experminental code ifdef newbase, unifying into one source structure, 
	and separating out gestures by sex(or voice later don't touch nwsnoaa)
	*	0034  EAB		04/6/98 		Oliver made me do it....I tuned the German intonation, in general he feels if should be quite flat so we're
	adding things trying to make it more natural and "alive" without overdoing it....
	0035  EAB		04/27/98		Many tuning changes for German and new version of languages, since this code is enabled by NEW_INTONATION
	which presently is only valid for German I didn't ifdef out the new stuff because it will be pervasive
	and I've already started tuning American English This file should be viewed conceptually as a new
	replaement for ph_drwt01.c being first submitted now for German 
	0036  EAB		5/18/98 		Found clauseposition after break instead of before in case statements 
	0037  EAB		7/13/98 		BATS 711 Whole file needs to be moved to RND.....
	0038  EAB		7/15/98 		BATS 704 see 0036 change
	0039  EAB		7/22/98 		scaled intonation in female voices to aovid over driving filter
	0040  EAB		8/17/98 		Modified segtars 3000 too strongon some also modified behavior on sentnences
	with multiple comma caluses.
	0041  EAB		09/11/1998		Evaluated new code base and made fixes and improvements, more work to be done.
	0042  EAB		10/16/1998		Tuned for new release of all languages on new_intonation platform.
	0043  EAB						Putting ENGLISH_UK onto this development base
	0044  EAB						Refinesd F1 F0 relationship 
	0055  EAB		10/20/1998		Reduce effect further for Spanish (f1 f0)
	0056  EAB	0044 11/09/1998 	UK_English male and female voice BATS 777
	if (new_intonation enabled for UK) This as part of the overall 5.0
	tuning process file in AD already contains changes 
	057  EAB		02/23/1999		Added in copyright plus new gov wording plus removed incorrect
	time adjustment(found Bill Hallhan had added comp in
	vtm
	*	056  EAB	05/03/1999		Fixed BATS 887
	*	057  MGS	12/17/1999		Fix for SAPI symbol conflict
